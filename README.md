Psychiatric disorders, encompassing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Depression, Bipolar Disorder (BD), and Schizophrenia, 
have long been a focal point of clinical and genetic research due to their widespread 
prevalence and profound impact on individuals and society. Collectively, these disorders 
affect a significant proportion of the global population, often imposing persistent 
challenges in daily living, relationships, and overall quality of life. 
ASD, a neurodevelopmental disorder, manifests in early childhood with impairments in 
social interaction and communication, coupled with repetitive behaviours. ADHD, another 
neurodevelopmental condition, presents symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and 
impulsivity. Depression, which affects millions worldwide, is characterized by pervasive 
feelings of sadness, loss of interest, and functional impairment. BD is marked by 
alternating episodes of mania and depression, while Schizophrenia presents with 
disturbances in cognition, emotion, and perception. (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention)
While these disorders exhibit distinct clinical features, intriguing overlaps exist in their 
aetiology:
1. Comorbidity Patterns: For example, ADHD and ASD are often co-diagnosed, and BD 
can coexist with either ADHD or Depression. These overlaps hint at potential shared 
etiological pathways.
2. Neuroimaging Insights: Modern neuroimaging techniques have unveiled consistent 
neural patterns across these disorders, particularly in areas critical for emotion regulation, 
executive functioning, and reward processing.
3. Neurochemical Pathways: Dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems play 
roles across these disorders, with shared dysfunctions evident in conditions like 
Depression and Schizophrenia.
4. Genetic Overlaps: Recent genetic studies have highlighted common genetic variants or 
loci predisposing individuals to multiple of these conditions. For instance, specific copy 
number variations (CNVs) are linked with both Schizophrenia and ASD.
Given these intersections, we formulate several hypotheses:
- There exists a Shared Genetic Architecture with considerable gene overlap across these 
disorders, suggesting a foundational genetic commonality.
- There are Disorder-Specific Genetic Signatures that account for the unique clinical 
presentations of each condition.
- These associated genes likely intersect at similar Molecular Pathways, underscoring 
potential shared molecular or cellular mechanisms.
Understanding the molecular intricacies shared and distinct among these disorders is 
crucial. By delving deeper into their genetic underpinnings, we can potentially

revolutionize therapeutic approaches, offering hope for more effective treatments and 
interventions. 
Our study is guided by the latest GWAS and WES datasets from reputable journals. 
Leveraging these resources, we embark on an integrative comparative analysis of genes 
associated with these psychiatric disorders. We aim to shed light on their common and 
unique molecular mechanisms, which could be monumental for future research and 
clinical practice. We also employ GO analysis and pathway analysis using the KEGG 
resource. By integrating these methodologies, we strive to present a comprehensive 
understanding of the molecular basis of these psychiatric disorders, propelling the field 
forward in its quest for more effective treatments and patient care solutions.
